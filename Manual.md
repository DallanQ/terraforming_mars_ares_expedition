## Overview (page 2)

**Terraforming Mars: Ares Expedition** is an engine-building game in which players control
interplanetary corporations with the goal of making Mars habitable (and profitable). You will do
this by investing **mega credits (MC)** into project cards that will directly or indirectly contribute
to the terraforming process. In order to win, you will want to accumulate a high **terraform rating (TR)**
and as many **victory points (VP)** as you can. Players raise their TR by increasing global
parameters: **oceans, oxygen, and temperature**. TR also determines each corporation’s basic
income, and, at the end of the game TR counts as VP. Additional VP and production capabilities
are awarded for building project cards and other actions taken during the game.

The game is played in rounds, and each round the players will choose one of five phases, which
determines which activities will take place during that round. This means every round is different,
but can consist of building new project cards, taking general and project-specific actions,
producing income and resources **(plants and heat)**, or researching to draw more project cards.
Every player will take all the phases selected for the round, and will receive a special bonus during
the phase that they selected. **To speed up the game, players should resolve each phase
simultaneously!**

The game board has tracks for oxygen, temperature, and terraform rating, as well as a place
for all of the ocean tiles that will be flipped over the course of the game. The game ends when
there is enough oxygen to breathe (14%), oceans enough to allow Earth-like weather (9), and the
temperature is well above freezing (+8°C). It will then be possible, if not comfortable, to live on the
surface of Mars!

The winner is the player with the most VP at the end of the game.

## Game Board (page 4)

The game board has four sections:

1. **TERRAFORMING RATING TRACK** - When you gain TR, you advance your player cube on this track.

2. **OCEANS** - This is where the ocean tokens are placed facedown at the start of the game. When you flip an ocean, pick an ocean that has the orange side faceup and flip it over, then gain 1 TR and the reward listed on the back of the flipped ocean tile.

3. **PHASE TRACKING TOKENS** - Place the phase tracking tokens along this side of the board.

4. **OXYGEN TRACK** - When you raise the oxygen, advance the cube on this track and gain 1 TR.

5. **TEMPERATURE TRACK** - When you raise the temperature, advance the cube on this track and gain 1 TR.

The oxygen and temperature tracks are each divided into four colors: purple, red, yellow, and white. Certain cards will require the oxygen or temperature to be in certain color zones.

## CARD ANATOMY (page 5)

### PROJECT CARDS (page 5)

Project cards are the backbone to building a powerful corporation in order to win the game. It is important to note that at any time you may discard a project card in your hand to gain 3 MC. Project cards have the following pieces of information on them:

> image of cards with the name at the top, the cost in the upper-left corner, the requirement below the cost on the left, the tags down the left side, the color on the left, the effect, production, capability and action at the bottom left, the ability at the bottom right, the vp down the right side and the card number underneath the ability.

1. **NAME**
  
2. **COST** - This is how much MC you must spend in order to play the card.

3. **REQUIREMENT** - Some cards have additional requirements in order to play them. This is shown in brief here and in more detail in the ability section (11) of the card.

4. **TAGS** - Cards can have up to three tags. Tags have no inherent value but are referenced in the ability section of many cards. 

5. **COLOR** - There are three colors of cards: blue (active), green (automated), and red (event).

A. Blue cards either have effects that trigger when certain things happen or actions that can be used during the action phase.

B. Green cards have resources that are gained in the production phase or have steel/titanium capabilities which are used to reduce the cost of playing certain cards. See page 12 for more info on steel and titanium.

C. Red cards have effects that happen immediately and do not provide any additional impact after they are played, other than the tags they provide that can be referenced by other cards.

6. **EFFECT** (Purple) - This appears only on blue cards and shows icons representing an effect which triggers when certain criteria are met. If an effect's condition is met multiple times when a card is played, then resolve the effect multiple times.

7. **PRODUCTION** (Orange) - This appears only on green cards and shows the icons of what this card produces during the production phase.

8. **CAPABILITY** (Gray) - This appears only on green cards and shows that this card has steel or titanium capabilities.

9. **ACTION** (Blue) - This appears only on blue cards and shows icons representing actions which happen during the action phase.

10. **ACTIVE PHASES** - This section only appears on green and blue cards. The roman numerals represent the phases in which the card's ability can be used.

11. **ABILITY** - This section lists any additional requirements needed to play the card (an icon of a golden check mark in a golden circle), any immediated effects of the card (an icon of electricity) and the ability of the card.

12. **VP** -This section shows how many points this card is worth at the end of the game.

13. **CARD NUMBER**

### CORPORATION CARDS (page 6)

These cards represent the corporation each player is acting as. Corporation cards have five parts:

> Image of a card with name at the top, a tag at the upper left corner, logo at the top middle, starting resources below the logo and beside the name, and the effect/action at the bottom of the card.

1. **NAME**

2. **TAG** - Tags have no inherent value but are mentioned in the ability section of many cards.
  
3. **LOGO**
   
4. **STARTING RESOURCES** - This section tells you how many mega credits (MC) you gain at the start of the game. It may also tell you if you start with any production or other abilities.

5. **EFFECT/ACTION** - This shows any ongoing effects or actions you have access to during the game.

### PHASE CARDS (page 6)

Players use phase cards to choose which phases they want to play this round. Phase cards have four parts:

> Image of a card with the phase number at the upper left corner, name beside the phase number, ability at the middle of the card and bonus at the bottom of the card 

1. **PHASE NUMBER** - The phases are resolved in order based on this number.

2. **NAME**

3. **ABILITY** - This is the effect that all players will resolve during this phase.

4. **BONUS** - This is the additional effect that you will resolve during this phase only if you selected this phase this round.

## Player Board (page 6)

The player board keeps track of your current resources and production. Resource cubes are placed in their respective boxes, and player markers are used on the production tracks.

1. **PHASES** - A brief description of the phases.

2. **PRODUCTION TRACKS** - When you gain production of a resource, move the corresponding cube on its track. Add a second cube to the right column if needed. There are four types of production: (a.) MC, (b.) card, (c.) heat, and (d.) plant. The production tracks show how much of each resource you will gain during the production phase.

*Example: If you gain two heat production on the first turn, move your player cube on the heat production track from 0 to 2.*

3. **RESOURCES** - Whenever you gain (a.) MC, (b.) heat, or (c.) plants, place the copper, silver, and gold cubes into the section corresponding to the resource gained. The copper cubes are worth 1, the silver 5, and the gold 10.

*Example: If you produce 6 plants, place 1 copper cube and 1 silver cube into the green resource section to the right of the plant production track on your player board.*

4. **CAPABILITIES** - When you gain (a.) steel or (b.) titanium capabilities, move the corresponding cube on its track. Add a second cube to the right column if needed.

5. **STANDARD ACTIONS** - During the action phase, players may perform as many of these actions as they want, any number of times.

> Image of a player board with the phases along the top, production tracks on the left, resources on the right, capabilities near the bottom, and standard actions at the bottom.

*Reminder: All resources are either tracked on the player board or on a card if it is a special resource. Use the copper, silver, and gold cubes to track the number of each resource you have. The copper cubes are worth 1, the silver 5, and the gold 10.*

*Note: Some production cards increase their production when you have more of a specific tag. You'll need to update your player mat every time you play that tag.*

*Note: You will always be able to calculate your current production and capabilities by looking at your cards in play. The player board is just more convenient.* 

## RESOURCES (page 7)

There are four different kinds of resources in **Terraforming Mars: Ares Expedition**: mega credits, heat, plants, and special resources.

### MEGA CREDITS (MC) (page 7)

> Image of a golden card with a letter C crested on it

MC is used to play cards and activate actions.

### HEAT (page 7)

> Image of a red card with three thunderbolts crested on it

Heat is used to raise the temperature of Mars. During the action phase, players may spend 8 heat to raise the temperature one step and gain 1 TR.

### PLANTS (page 7)

> Image of a green card with a leaf crested on it

Plants are used to make forests, which raise the oxygen on Mars. During the action phase, players may spend 8 plants to gain a forest VP, raise the oxygen one step, and gain 1 TR.

### SPECIAL RESOURCES (page 7)

> Image of a green card with a paw crested on it, Image of a microbe, and an image of a white card with an atom crested on it. 

Some cards allow you to place special resources (**animals**, **microbes**, and **science**) on that or other cards. These resources do different things, as specified by the different cards.

## Other Tokens (page 7)

### FOREST VP TOKENS (page 7)

> Image of a forest in the shape of hexagon

Awarded when a forest is built. Worth 1 VP at the end of the game. There are 5 VP forest tokens in case you run out of 1's.

### PHASE TRACKING TOKENS (page 7)

> Image of a card with a white one and a selected phase 

Show which phases were selected by all players during the round.

### OCEAN TILES (page 7)

> Image of an ocean in a hexagon shape

During setup, place these on the board with the orange side faceup. When you flip an ocean over to the blue side, you will receive the benefit shown on that side. For example, if you flip the tile shown to the left, you gain 2 plants. Once an ocean tile is blue side up, it cannot be flipped over again.

## SETUP (page 8)

1. Set the game board in the middle of the table. 

2. Set the phase tracking tokens next to the game board with the closed door side up.

3. Set all of the forest VP and the copper, silver, and gold cubes next to the game board.

4. Place the two clear cubes on -30° C on the temperature track and 0% on the oxygen track. 

5. Give each player a player board and the 13 cubes in their player color. Each player places a cube on the '0' space of each of the six production tracks on their player boards and a cube on the '5' of the TR track on the game board. Use the other cubes when you have 10 or more production/capabilities.

6. Shuffle the ocean tiles blue side down and place them on the nine ocean spaces on the board.

7. ***For your first game** instead of performing step 7, find the sixteen green project cards that have a ( white star) next to the card number. Shuffle them and deal each player four of those cards. Place any remaining cards with a (icon of a white star) in the discard pile. The rest of the project cards are already shuffled. Feel free to cut the deck, then deal four more cards to each player.*

> Image of shuffled cards facedown being dealt
> Image of a green project card with a white star next to its card number (first game).

Shuffle all of the project cards together facedown to form the project card deck. Deal each player eight project cards. You will keep all of them. Split the deck into two piles so that all players can easily reach one of the decks.

8. ***For your first game**, instead of performing step 8, deal each player one of the corporation cards with a (icon of a black star) next to its card number.*

Shuffle all of the corporation cards facedown and deal each player two corporation cards. Each player picks one to use for the game and discards the other. Return all unused corporation cards to the box.

> Image of the two dealt cards yellow downward arrow to one dealt card to be used for the game
> Image of a corporation card with a black star next to its card number (first game)

***Advanced Rule**: Once you have been dealt your corporations, but before you have chosen which one you want to use, you may discard any number of project cards and draw that same amount.* 

9. Each player receives any starting resources and abilities from their corporation.

> Image of a card with starting resources and effect
> Image of three copper cubes, one silver and two golden cubes

10. Give each player a set of five phase cards corresponding to their player color.

> Image of five phase cards with individual colour

11. Start the game.

## GAMEPLAY (page 10)

The game is played over the course of several rounds. Each round is divided into three steps:

A. PLANNING STEP *(pg. 10)* 

B. RESOLVE PHASES STEP *(pgs. 11-15)*

C. END STEP *(pg. 16)*

In each step and phase, players play simultaneously. Not all phases will happen every round. Each round will always start with a planning step in which players will determine which phases will occur that round.

### A. PLANNING STEP (page 10)

Each player simultaneously chooses a phase card from their hand and places it facedown.

Starting with the second round, players will place this card at a 90° angle on top of the last phase card they chose. Players are not allowed to pick the same phase two rounds in a row. After revealing the played phase card, players will return the phase card they chose from the previous round to their hand.

Once all players have done this, the chosen phase cards are revealed. These cards determine which phases are resolved this round. For each phase that was chosen for this round, flip the associated phase tracking token faceup so that the name of the phase is showing.

> Image of a phase card placed at a 90 degree angle on top of the last card they choose and a yellow arrow pointing sideways to an image of a revealed phase card

*A player is not allowed to pick the same phase two rounds in a row*

### B. RESOLVE PHASES STEP (page 11)

During this step, players resolve the phases that were chosen during the planning step. The chosen phases are always resolved in the following order:

- I. DEVELOPMENT PHASE *(pg. 11)*

- II. CONSTRUCTION PHASE *(pg. 12)*

- III. ACTION PHASE *(pg. 14)*

- IV. PRODUCTION PHASE *(pg. 15)*

- V. RESEARCH PHASE *(pg. 15)*

Each player resolves each of the chosen phases (and only the chosen phases) once in this round. Players resolve each other chosen phase simultaneously. Once all players have finished with a phase, they all move onto the next chosen phase.

If multiple players choose the same phase, that phase is resolved only once. If a phase is not chosen, each player skips that phase this round.

When you choose a phrase, you will receive the specific bonus in that phrase that is listed at the bottom of the phrase card.

> Image of a bonus phase card with gain 4 MC in a yellow circle

#### I DEVELOPMENT PHASE: (page 11)

During this phase, each player may play one green project card from their hand by paying its cost. See Playing Project Cards on page 12. ***Bonus: If you chose this phase, the cost of the card you play this phase is reduced by 3 MC***.

> Image of a green development card stating Each player may play one green project card and Pay 3MC less for the card you play this phase.

*After playing a green card, make sure to adjust the corresponding capability or production track on your player board.*

*Reminder: Players may discard project cards in hand at any time to gain 3 MC. This can be done for any reason. Whenever a player discards a card for any reason, it is discarded facedown to the project card discard pile.*

#### II CONSTRUCTION PHASE: (page 12)

During this phase, each player may play one blue or one red project card from their hand by paying its cost. ***Bonus: If you chose this phase, you can either: Draw a card before or after playing a card this phase OR you may play an additional blue or red card this phase.***

> Image of a red or blue costruction card stating Each player may play one blue or one red card and Draw a card or Play an additional blue card or red card this phase.

***Tip to save table space**: Play green cards along the bottom of your player board on the right side. You can overlap them so that just the production box and tags along the left side are showing.* 

*Play blue cards in a row above your green cards. You can overlap them so that just the ability icons and tags along the left side are showing.* 

*Play red cards in either row, you can overlap them so just the tags are showing.*

##### PLAYING PROJECT CARDS (page 12)

The cost to play a project card must be paid with MC. You can use MC cubes you have and/or discard other project cards in your hand at a rate of 3 MC per card. Any overpayment in cards is returned to you using cubes. (***Ex. You can play an 8 MC card by discarding two cards and paying 2 MC, or by discarding three cards in hand. If you discard the three cards, you will receive 1 MC back.***)

###### REQUIREMENTS (page 12)

Some cards have additional requirements in order to play them. Cards with requirements have a checkmark icon (an icon of a checkmark) next to the cost of the card. These requirements are listed in the text box at the bottom of the card next to the same checkmark icon (an icon of a checkmark) and shown in icons at the top. If a card has an ocean, oxygen or temperature requirement, that requirement needs to have been met **at the start of the phase** in order for you to be able to play it. *If the requirements of a card are not met, you cannot play that card.*

###### STEEL AND TITANIUM (page 12)

The cost of Project cards with a building tag (an icon of a building tag), regardless of color, is reduced by 2 MC for each steel (an image of steel) you have.

The cost of Project cards with a space tag (an icon of a space tag), regardless of color, is reduced by 3 MC for each titanium (an image of titanium) you have.

The cost to play a card cannot be reduced below zero.

You may play cards that raise parameters beyond their maximums or add special resources when you don't have a card to add them to. You will simply not receive the benefits of those effects.

***Example***: *Bob wants to play Microprocessors, which is a green card that costs 17 MC. Microprocessors has a building tag (an icon of a building tag). (an icon of number 1) Bob has two steel, so his cost to play cards with building tags is reduced by 4 MC. (an icon of number 2) Bob chose the development phase this turn, so his cost to play this green card is reduced by 3 MC. Thus, Bob's cost to play Microprocessors is 17-4-3=10.*

*(an icon of number 3) Bob has 4 MC cubes which he can use to pay for the card, but that leaves Bob 6 MC short of playing it. Bob can discard two project cards from his hand at a rate of 3 MC each to pay for the remaining 6 MC. (an icon of number 4) Bob chooses to discard two cards and spends his 4 MC cubes, and places Microprocessors into play.*

*(an icon of number 5) Bob resolves the immediate effect of the card which is "Draw two cards. Then, discard a card." Finally, Bob is done with the development phase.*

> Image of a card with two steel and another card with development phase

> Image of two discarded card with one overlapping the other and a white palm above them

> Image of four copper cubes plus an image of two project cards side by side with a white palm above them 

#### III ACTION PHASE: (page 14)

Each player may resolve the "Action:" ability on each of their cards in play once during this phase. Each player may resolve any number of the standard actions any number of times. ***Bonus: If you chose this phase, you may resolve the "Action:" ability on one of your cards in play an additional time.***

> Image of an action card stating Each player activates any "Action:" effects and Standard Actions You may activate one "Action:" an additional time.

##### STANDARD ACTONS (page 14)

During the action phase, players may use the standard actions printed on their player boards. Those actions are:

> image of eight plant card right arrow pointing at forest vp

- Spend 8 plants to gain a forest VP and raise the oxygen one step.

> Image of number 20 on a yellow card right arrow pointing at an image of a tree in a green pentagon 

- Spend 20 MC to gain a forest VP and raise the oxygen one step.

> Image of eight heat card right arrow pointing at an image of a thermometer

- Spend 8 heat to raise the temperature one step.

> Image of number 14 on a yellow card right arrow pointing at an image of a thermometer

- Spend 14 MC to raise the temperature one step.

> Image of number 15 on a yellow card right arrow pointing at an image of an ocean tile

- Spend 15 MC to flip an ocean tile. When a player flips an ocean tile, they immediately receive the reward shown on the back of the tile.

*Reminder*: Whenever you raise oxygen, raise temperature, or flip an ocean, you gain 1 TR. This happens for each step you raise those parameters.

During the phase in which a global parameter reaches it's maximum (temperature at +8°C, oxygen at 14%, or 9 ocean tiles flipped), all players can continue to take actions or play cards to increase that parameter. They will receive all of the benefits, such as forest VP and TR. During the phase that the last ocean tile is flipped, any player who continues to take actions or play cards to flip oceans will gain the reward on the last ocean tile that was flipped in addition to the TR.

After the phase in which the parameter reached it's maximum, players can no longer gain rewards for increasing that parameter.

Players may continue to gain forest VP tokens for building forests after the phase when oxygen reaches 14%, but won't gain TR for increasing oxygen when they do.

Important Rule: At the end of the action phase, if you are able to spend heat or plants for a standard action, you must do so unless the associated terraforming parameter has already been raised to its maximum.

#### IV PRODUCTION PHASE: (page 15)

During this phase, each player collects resources equal to the production on their green cards, corporation card, and place on the TR track. ***Bonus: If you chose this phase, gain 4 MC.***

> Image of a production card stating Each player gains heats, plants, and draws cards according to their production. They also gain MC equal to their production + TR. and Gain 4 MC

> Image of a copper, silver and gold cube and a production phase card 

Gain MC equal to your MC production + your TR. Gain heat and plants equal to your production for those resources. Place copper (1), silver (5), and gold (10) cubes to track these resources in the appropriate resource section of your player board. For each card production, you draw a card during this phase.

Example: Bob has played four cards, shown below, so far this game. When he played these cards, he adjusted his player board accordingly. During the planning step of this round, he chose to play the production phase. During the production phase, Bob will gain all of the resources shown on his player board plus MC equal to his TR, which he can verify by checking the production boxes on the cards he has played. He gains the following:

1. 4 MC for his MC production and 6 MC for his TR

2. 1 card 

3. 3 heat 

4. 1 plant 

5. 4 MC as a bonus for choosing the production phase.

> Image of a big board with player boards adjusted to play production phase

#### V RESEARCH PHASE: (page 15)

Each player draws two cards, keeps one, and discards the other. ***Bonus: If you chose this phase, you draw three additional cards and keep one additional card. Meaning, in total, you draw five cards and keep two, discarding the other three.***

If at any point, a player needs to draw a project card and the project card deck is empty, shuffle all of the discarded project cards together to form a new project card deck.

> Image of a yellow research card stating All players draw play two cards and keep it and Draw an additional three cards and keep one additional card.


### C. END STEP (page 16)

During this step, each player discards down to ten cards in hand. For each card discarded this way, that player gains 3 MC as normal.

Flip all of the phase tracker tokens so that the closed door side is faceup, and start the next round.

## END OF THE GAME (page 16)

The end of the game is triggered when all three of the following are true:

1. All nine ocean tiles have been flipped blue side up. 

2. The temperature is at +8°C. 

3. Oxygen is at 14%.

Once this happens, players finish the current phase and then proceed to final scoring. The round does not continue to any other phases that were picked. For example, if all of the global parameters are capped during the construction phase, and the action and production phases were also chosen for this round, the game does not continue to the action or production phase.

Tip: If the game ends during the action phase, players will likely want to convert all of their cards in hand and MC into standard actions that gain TR.

### FINAL SCORING: (page 16)

Players score VP for the following things

1. 1 VP per TR 

2. VP equal to their forest VP tokens 

3. VP equal to what is printed on the project cards they played, including cards that have variable VP denoted with an asterisk*

The player with the highest total VP wins the game. In the event of a tie, the tied player with the most heat, MC, and plant resources added together is the winner. Be sure to convert project cards in hand to MC beforehand.

***Example:*** At the end of the game, Bob totals his final score: 

He has 25 TR as shown on the TR track. 

He has 6 forest VP. 

He has four project cards with VP on them, for a total of 9 VP. 

He also has a project card with variable VP worth 1 VP per 2 animals on the card. Bob added 6 animals (resource cubes) to this card over the course of the game, so it is worth 3VP. 

Bob's final score is 25+6+9+3=43.

> Image of TR track with a blue cube at 25, two forest VP with one have a five written on it, four project cards with one, two, three, and four on them respectively, and a project card stating 1 VP per 2 animals on this card and effect. 

## SYMBOLS (page 17)

All abilities and requirements on project cards are shown both with symbols and explained in text. Below is a glossary of all symbols you will see on project cards.

### VICTORY POINTS AND TERRAFORMING RATING (page 17)

#### VICTORY POINTS (VP) (page 17)

> image of a brown circle with a 1 inside

> image of a brown circle with an asterisk inside 

Points that will add to your score at the end of the game. Some cards have either a set number of VP on them, or a number contingent on another factor (such as resources on the card or certain cards in play). You win the game by having the most VP. *Taking the time to terraform in a sustainable, environmentally conscious way, create impressive structures, and bring beautiful creatures to our new planet, will ultimately be rewarded.*

#### TERRAFORM RATING (TR) (page 17)

Points that will both produce MC throughout the game and add to your score at the end of the game. TR is the measure of how much you have contributed to the terraforming process. Each time you raise the temperature, the oxygen level, or flip an ocean tile, your TR increases. *Every step towards terraforming is its own reward, but as an added bonus, there are also government stipends in return for your hard work making Mars habitable.*

### PARAMETERS (page 17)

There are three parameters that gauge how much Mars has been terraformed: temperature, oxygen, and oceans. You and your fellow players are competing to contribute the most to the terraforming of Mars. Each of these symbols indicates raising the associated parameter one time. Each time you raise one of these parameters, you will gain 1 TR. *Every aspect of preparing our new home is equally important. Only when our atmosphere and ocean levels are perfectly maintained can we begin to bring over our citizens.*

#### TEMPERATURE (page 17)

> Image of a thermometer

Raise the temperature by 2˚C. Heat, MC, or effects on cards can be used to increase the temperature. The temperature starts at -30˚C and can be raised 2˚C at a time up to +8˚C. This will create an equatorial zone where water stays liquid.

#### OXYGEN (page 17)

> Image of two molecules on a plate

Raise the oxygen by 1%. Plants, MC, or effects on cards can be used to raise the oxygen level. The oxygen starts at 0% and can be raised 1% at a time up to 14%. At 14% the atmosphere resembles that of Earth at a 3000m elevation.

#### OCEANS (page 17)

> Image of water in hexagon shape

Flip one ocean tile. MC or effects on cards can be used to flip ocean tiles. Each ocean tile represents 1% ocean coverage. The ocean coverage starts at 0% and can be raised 1% at a time to 9% (or, 9 ocean tiles). With 9% of the surface covered by oceans, Mars will have a hydrological cycle, creating rain and rivers.

### RESOURCES (page 17)

There are four types of resources that can be used in your corporation's work to terraform Mars: MC, plants, heat, and special resources (animals, microbes, and science).

#### MEGA CREDITS (MC) (page 17)

> Image of a golden card with a letter C crested on it

This is the currency used in the 24th century and is how your corporation will pay to complete projects and take certain actions.

#### PLANTS (page 17)

> Image of a green card with a leaf crested on it

Plants represent the hard work your corporation is putting in to increase the forest coverage on Mars. Plants are a resource you can use to build forests and raise the oxygen.

#### HEAT (page 17)

> Image of a red card with three thunderbolts crested on it

Heat represents your corporation's efforts to make the temperature of Mars habitable. Heat is a resource you can use to raise the temperature 2˚C.

#### SPECIAL RESOURCES (page 17)

> Image of a green card with a paw crested on it, Image of a light green card with two sticks adjacent to each other and a ball in between, and an image of a white card with an atom crested on it.

Your corporation can invest itself in the animals, the microbes, or the science resources of humanity's future home. These three special resources are collected on project cards to be used for specific effects.

### CAPABILITIES - STEEL AND TITANIUM (page 18)

Some green cards give a player steel and titanium capabilities. They reduce the cost of playing project cards. The proper building materials are essential when starting an expensive project!

#### STEEL (page 18)

> Image of a brown card with a hammer and screw on it

This represents building materials used on Mars. Each steel capability lowers the cost of playing project cards with a building tag (image of a building tag) By 2 Mc.

#### TITANIUM (page 18)

> Image of a black card with a golden star on it

This represents building materials used in space. Each titanium capability lowers the cost of playing project cards with a space tag (image of a space tag) By 3 Mc.

### TAGS (page 18)

Project cards can have up to three tags on them, which can be referenced by some cards' effects.

#### BUILDING (page 18)

> Image of a brown circle with a building on it

This project involves construction on Mars, and can be cheaper to produce using steel.

#### SPACE (page 18)

> Image of a black circle with a shining star

This project uses space technology, and can be cheaper to produce using titanium.

#### POWER (page 18)

> Image of a purple circle with a thunderbolt on it

When an icon has an asterisk (*) next to it, there is a special rule that you must read in the ability text on the card.

## TWO-PLAYER CO-OP MODE (page 18)

In this mode, two players work together to completely terraform Mars before time runs out. All the rules of the game are the same with the following exceptions:

### SETUP (page 18)

After you have finished setting up the game, in the upper right hand section of the game board, place 27 copper cubes and 3 cubes of a player color you are not using in a pile.

### GAMEPLAY (page 18)

Players should give each other advice and encouragement! We recommend that you don't discuss specific cards in your hand, but rather keep your statements broad, like, "I have a lot of heat production, so don't worry about that" or "I'm going to choose the production phase this round."

After players have revealed their phase cards each round, each player takes a cube from the pile on the game board. If you take a copper cube, add it to your MC. If you take one of the player color cubes, discard the cube and you may trade one project card in hand for a project card in your partner's hand.

### END OF THE GAME (page 18) 

The game ends at the end of the round in which the last cube is taken from the pile (15 rounds).

At the end of the game, if all of the terraforming parameters have been completed and the players have a total score of at least 80 VP, the players win! Otherwise, the players lose. Record your VP and try to beat your high score the next time you play.

## SOLO RULES (page 19)

The goal of the solo game is to fully terraform Mars before time runs out.

All the rules of the game are the same with the following exceptions:

### SETUP (page 19)

1. Set aside an additional set of five phase cards as a dummy hand. Shuffle that set of cards facedown.

2. Place a player cube of a color you are not using on the 1 on the TR track.

3. Choose a difficulty level: Novice, Advanced, or Expert.

### GAMEPLAY (page 19)

Once you have selected a phase card during the beginning phase, play the top card of the dummy hand faceup. That phase is also played this round (without a bonus). Continue to play rounds, playing a card from the dummy hand each round.

When all five dummy hand cards have been played, shuffle them all facedown to reform the dummy hand. Each time you reshuffle the dummy hand, advance the dummy player cube (that started on 1) to the next space on the TR track. Once that cube reaches 5, play five final rounds. You are allowed to pick the order in which the dummy hand phase cards are played in these final rounds. After all of the phase cards from that hand have been played (25 rounds in total), the game ends.

#### DIFFICULTY LEVELS (page 19)

Solo mode can be a great way to learn the game, but it is not easy to win if you aren't experienced with the game and its many strategies. If you aren't experienced, consider choosing one of the lower difficulty settings below. In a lower difficulty setting, the terraforming parameters will advance each time the dummy player's cube moves (4 times per game), to help you reach your terraforming goals. **Note - raising terraforming parameters in this manner does not provide TR nor Forest VP tokens.**

- **NOVICE MODE**: Increase oxygen or temperature 2 steps after advancing the dummy player's cube.

- **ADVANCED MODE**: Increase oxygen or temperature 1 step after advancing the dummy player's cube.

- **EXPERT MODE**: No bonuses are given.

### END OF GAME 

Once five full dummy hands have been played (25 rounds), the game ends. If Mars is fully terraformed, you win. Otherwise, you lose. Finally, you score VP, attempting to achieve as high a score as possible.

*Did you see the two-player co-op rules on the previous page?*

## GAME OVERVIEW (page 20)

The game is played over the course of several rounds. Each round is divided into three steps:

### A. PLANNING STEP 

Each player simultaneously chooses a phase card from their hand and places it facedown. **A player is not allowed to pick the same phase two rounds in a row**.

### B. RESOLVE PHASES STEP 

During this step, players resolve the phases that were chosen during the planning step. There are no turns, so each player plays each phase at the same time. All players may participate in the selected phases, but players only receive bonuses for the phase they selected. Bonuses are printed in the bottom section of the phase cards. The chosen phases are always resolved in the following order:

- **I. DEVELOPMENT PHASE** Each player may play one green project card from their hand by paying its cost.
- **II. CONSTRUCTION PHASE** Each player may play one blue or one red project card from their hand by paying its cost.
- **III. ACTION PHASE** - Each player may resolve the "Action:" ability on each of their blue cards in play once.
- **IV. PRODUCTION PHASE** - Each player collects MC equal to their TR and resources based on their green cards and their corporation card.
- **V. RESEARCH PHASE** - Each player draws two cards, keeps one, and discards the other.

## C. END STEP (page 20) 

During this step, each player discards down to ten cards in hand. For each card discarded this way, that player gains 3 MC as normal.

Flip all of the phase tracker tokens so that the closed door side is faceup, and start the next round.

The game ends when all of the global parameters have been completed. The player with the most VP wins!

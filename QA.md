> In solo mode, if the same phase card that I selected emerges after drawing from the dummy hand, do I play the phase twice?

No, you don't. You just play that phase once and you will have the action bonus for playing the card for it. It would just be like if you were playing with another player and both played the same action.

[first-solo-play-a-few-clarifications](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2721839/first-solo-play-a-few-clarifications)

> In Solo mode in Novice mode at what point do you raise the oxygen or temperature 2 steps when the AI uses all 5 phase cards?  Is it as soon as the AI plays that last phase card (so before the phases actually play out) or at the end of that round?

You raise oxygen or temperature right after you move the tracker cube one spot up, after the round of the 5th card. This means: a) you fully play both phases you and the AI played, and once you start to prepare the next round (shuffle AI cards and move the tracker) you will raise one of the tracks; b) you will do this a total of 4 times (in novice means you do a total of 8 raises, 4x2)

> In Solo mode in Novice mode do you have to raise either oxygen or temperature 2 steps and can’t raise each once instead?

Quoting: "Increase oxygen OR temperature 2 steps after advancing the dummy player's cube." 
The rules specifically state that you can raise one or the other and not both.

> The rules say the solo game ends when the AI has played its final phase card but does it actually mean at the end of that round? 

Yes, at the end of the round.

Yes, If the game ends during the Action phase, players will likely want to convert all of their cards in hand and MC into standard actions that gain TR.

The tracks on the left should correspond to the number of relevant production icons in your played projects. They track the rate at which you produce resources. They are generally advanced as a result of a Development or Construction phase. The bins on the right contain your current actual resources as a result of accumulated production (minus spending). They increase during a Production phase and they are spent during an Action phase.

It should be activated per tag, so yes the corporation card should start with two animals on it. A card can trigger the same effect multiple times.
See page 5 step 6 of the rulebook. So if you play a card with a plant and animal tag, and you have a card that triggers when you play either of those two tags, it will trigger twice

When you raise any of the global parameters to its maximum on a single phase, everyone continues to get the benefit. There is no "first come" basis because of the simultaneous nature of this version of the game. So when it maxes out, during the same phase, everyone can continue to get the benefit. Then starting the next phase, it is no longer available.
If it is the oceans that hit their max, then everyone gets the reward shown on the last tile flipped.

No. If an in-game effect, such as a project effect or the research phase, has you discarding a card then you don't get 3 MC for that. You only get the 3 MC if you choose to discard a card outside of such effects.

The action card states that any actions from cards you have played can each be activated once. The bonus is that one of your cards with an action may be activated a second time. The bonus has to do with the cards, not the standard actions. The standard actions are unlimited, bonus, or otherwise.

> When do you gain resources vs. when do you move your track (player board up)?

Read the first sentence of the Production Phase (p. 15) carefully. It says "Each player collects resources equal to the production on their green cards, corporation card, and place on the TR track." It does NOT mention referencing your player board because you technically do not need to use the player boards at all they are simply a note-taking device to help streamline the production step so you don't have to go through every single card in your tableau every time production happens. But that is why the green cards are worded the way they are, because every time production happens you re-evaluate your production values and take what they tell you to take. Using the player boards, It is much easier to keep on top of the small changes upfront. On p. 11, a red box in the Development Phase section reminds you to update your tracks when you play green cards that give you production (orange hashed box) or capabilities (grey hashed box). This is the only time you update your tracks: when you play green cards.

Both get to raise it simultaneously, and both get a Greenery tile, and they both get the TR. If they want to pay for more oxygen raises this Action phase, they can get the TR for it. After this phase is over, the Oxygen is done, and nobody can raise it for TR. They can still do any action that would raise the oxygen, but they would not get the TR. So if you get enough plants on a later action phase (before both temp and Oceans are done) you can still get a Greenery tile for it's endgame point, but no TR. Any other action that raises Oxygen as an effect can be activated similarly, without any TR.

It's dependent on the flow of the game. The first player in real time to choose to flip an ocean does so. Etc. So the last ocean flipped in real time is the last ocean flipped. If a player uses an effect to flip two oceans at once, the last ocean flipped is the one they flipped over second. If they use both hands to flip them over at the same time to be a pain, then get new friends

Whatever the last ocean tile is, you get that reward as many times as you "buy" it.

> When you spend 8 plants and/or 20 MC to raise the Oxygen you raise your TR also correct? But these actions also gives you a forest token so it is another TR per token when the game ends correct? So basically raising the oxygen gives you 1+1=2 TR in total compared to other standard actions that gives you only 1 TR. Is this right or wrong?

Raising Oxygen increases your TR, as long as Oxygen is not maxed out at the start of the Phase. The Forest token gives you a victory point at the end of the game. As TR is converted to victory points at game end then yes, you could in effect score 2 VPs for a Forest tile. But note the difference between TR (usable on future turns to generate income) and VPs (apply only at the end of the game). This action does give you 2 points (1 for the TR, 1 for the forest token), but only a single TR on the track (for income, etc.)

You both get as many oceans as you can afford. To determine which bonus you get it is important to only flip one ocean tile at a time. Whichever ocean tile was flipped last has the bonus that will be awarded to all further ocean actions for the rest of the phase.
You can find the rule on page 14 in the rulebook:
During the phase in which a global parameter reaches its maximum (temperature at +8°C, oxygen at 14%, or 9 ocean tiles fipped), all players can continue to take actions or play cards to increase that parameter. They will receive all of the benefits, such as forest VP and TR.

> In solo mode, if the same phase card that I selected emerges after drawing from the dummy hand, do I play the phase twice?

No, you don't. You just play that phase once and you will have the action bonus for playing the card for it. It would just be like if you were playing with another player and both played the same action.

Page 19

The goal of the solo game is to fully terraform Mars before time runs out.

All the rules of the game are the same with the following exceptions:

1. Set aside an additional set of five phase cards as a dummy hand. Shuffle that set of cards facedown.

2. Place a player cube of a color you are not using on the 1 on the TR track.

3. Choose a difficulty level: Novice, Advanced, or Expert.

----
Page 10

Each player simultaneously chooses a phase card from their hand and places it facedown.

Starting with the second round, players will place this card at a 90° angle on top of the last phase card they chose. Players are not allowed to pick the same phase two rounds in a row. After revealing the played phase card, players will return the phase card they chose from the previous round to their hand.

Once all players have done this, the chosen phase cards are revealed. These cards determine which phases are resolved this round. For each phase that was chosen for this round, flip the associated phase tracking token faceup so that the name of the phase is showing.

A player is not allowed to pick the same phase two rounds in a row

----
Page 11

Each player resolves each of the chosen phases (and only the chosen phases) once in this round. Players resolve each other chosen phase simultaneously. Once all players have finished with a phase, they all move onto the next chosen phase.

If multiple players choose the same phase, that phase is resolved only once. If a phase is not chosen, each player skips that phase this round.


[first-solo-play-a-few-clarifications](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2721839/first-solo-play-a-few-clarifications)

> In Solo mode in Novice mode at what point do you raise the oxygen or temperature 2 steps when the AI uses all 5 phase cards?  Is it as soon as the AI plays that last phase card (so before the phases actually play out) or at the end of that round?

You raise oxygen or temperature right after you move the tracker cube one spot up, after the round of the 5th card. This means: a) you fully play both phases you and the AI played, and once you start to prepare the next round (shuffle AI cards and move the tracker) you will raise one of the tracks; b) you will do this a total of 4 times (in novice means you do a total of 8 raises, 4x2)

----
Page 19

In a lower difficulty setting, the terraforming parameters will advance each time the dummy player's cube moves (4 times per game), to help you reach your terraforming goals. 

> In Solo mode in Novice mode do you have to raise either oxygen or temperature 2 steps and can’t raise each once instead?

Quoting: "Increase oxygen OR temperature 2 steps after advancing the dummy player's cube." 
The rules specifically state that you can raise one or the other and not both.

----
Page 19

NOVICE MODE: Increase oxygen or temperature 2 steps after advancing the dummy player's cube.

> The rules say the solo game ends when the AI has played its final phase card but does it actually mean at the end of that round? 

Yes, at the end of the round.

----
Page 19

Once five full dummy hands have been played (25 rounds), the game ends. If Mars is fully terraformed, you win. Otherwise, you lose. Finally, you score VP, attempting to achieve as high a score as possible.

----
page 5

Project cards are the backbone to building a powerful corporation in order to win the game. It is important to note that at any time you may discard a project card in your hand to gain 3 MC.

----
Page 11

DEVELOPMENT PHASE: During this phase, each player may play one green project card from their hand by paying its cost. See Playing Project Cards on page 12. Bonus: If you chose this phase, the cost of the card you play this phase is reduced by 3 MC.

After playing a green card, make sure to adjust the corresponding capability or production track on your player board.

Reminder: Players may discard project cards in hand at any time to gain 3 MC. This can be done for any reason. Whenever a player discards a card for any reason, it is discarded facedown to the project card discard pile.

[basic-question-about-productionresource-tracking-f](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2850193/basic-question-about-productionresource-tracking-f)

> Should the MC cubes on the right side of the board correspond to the number on the left track? If so, is this redundant? If not, what is the distinction I'm missing?

The tracks on the left should correspond to the number of relevant production icons in your played projects. They track the rate at which you produce resources. They are generally advanced as a result of a Development or Construction phase. The bins on the right contain your current actual resources as a result of accumulated production (minus spending). They increase during a Production phase and they are spent during an Action phase.

----
Page 6

The player board keeps track of your current resources and production. Resource cubes are placed in their respective boxes, and player markers are used on the production tracks.

PRODUCTION TRACKS - When you gain production of a resource, move the corresponding cube on its track. Add a second cube to the right column if needed. There are four types of production: (a.) MC, (b.) card, (c.) heat, and (d.) plant. The production tracks show how much of each resource you will gain during the production phase.

Example: If you gain two heat production on the first turn, move your player cube on the heat production track from 0 to 2.

RESOURCES - Whenever you gain (a.) MC, (b.) heat, or (c.) plants, place the copper, silver, and gold cubes into the section corresponding to the resource gained. The copper cubes are worth 1, the silver 5, and the gold 10.
Example: If you produce 6 plants, place 1 copper cube and 1 silver cube into the green resource section to the right of the plant production track on your player board.

CAPABILITIES - When you gain (a.) steel or (b.) titanium capabilities, move the corresponding cube on its track. Add a second cube to the right column if needed.

> how do tags work? for example, there is the corporation arklight, which says to add an animal to it every time it plays an animal / plant mark, including itself. the question is do i add the animal once per card or per mark? for the corporation card itself, I immediately add two animals, since there are two marks, or one?

It should be activated per tag, so yes the corporation card should start with two animals on it. A card can trigger the same effect multiple times.
See page 5 step 6 of the rulebook. So if you play a card with a plant and animal tag, and you have a card that triggers when you play either of those two tags, it will trigger twice

----
Page 5

TAGS - Cards can have up to three tags. Tags have no inherent value but are referenced in the ability section of many cards.

EFFECT (Purple) - This appears only on blue cards and shows icons representing an effect which triggers when certain criteria are met. If an effect's condition is met multiple times when a card is played, then resolve the effect multiple times.

[atmosphere-filtering-do-you-gain-a-tr-with-the-rai](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3031362/atmosphere-filtering-do-you-gain-a-tr-with-the-rai)

> The card Atmosphere filtering #67, says required 2 science, raise the oxygen 1 step. Do I gain a TR when I raise this oxygen 1 step?

Yes. Whenever you increase any of the three parameters by any means, you increase your TR respectively unless the card says otherwise.

----
Page 2

Players raise their TR by increasing global parameters: oceans, oxygen, and temperature. TR also determines each corporation’s basic income, and, at the end of the game TR counts as VP. Additional VP and production capabilities are awarded for building project cards and other actions taken during the game.

----
Page 14

Reminder: Whenever you raise oxygen, raise temperature, or flip an ocean, you gain 1 TR. This happens for each step you raise those parameters.

During the phase in which a global parameter reaches it's maximum (temperature at +8°C, oxygen at 14%, or 9 ocean tiles flipped), all players can continue to take actions or play cards to increase that parameter. They will receive all of the benefits, such as forest VP and TR. During the phase that the last ocean tile is flipped, any player who continues to take actions or play cards to flip oceans will gain the reward on the last ocean tile that was flipped in addition to the TR.

After the phase in which the parameter reached it's maximum, players can no longer gain rewards for increasing that parameter.

Players may continue to gain forest VP tokens for building forests after the phase when oxygen reaches 14%, but won't gain TR for increasing oxygen when they do.

Important Rule: At the end of the action phase, if you are able to spend heat or plants for a standard action, you must do so unless the associated terraforming parameter has already been raised to its maximum.

[order-of-turn-during-action-phase](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2831785/order-of-turn-during-action-phase)

> Should we play one action at a time during the action phase or do all your actions one time and then it's the other player turn?

When you raise any of the global parameters to its maximum on a single phase, everyone continues to get the benefit. There is no "first come" basis because of the simultaneous nature of this version of the game. So when it maxes out, during the same phase, everyone can continue to get the benefit. Then starting the next phase, it is no longer available.
If it is the oceans that hit their max, then everyone gets the reward shown on the last tile flipped.

----
Page 14

During the phase that the last ocean tile is flipped, any player who continues to take actions or play cards to flip oceans will gain the reward on the last ocean tile that was flipped in addition to the TR.

> For the Action phase, the rule book states that you are able to activate the standard action during the action phase as many times as you want, and the Action phase card states for the bonus that you may perform an Action again during your turn. Are they basically the same in regard to standard actions that are on the player boards?

The action card states that any actions from cards you have played can each be activated once. The bonus is that one of your cards with an action may be activated a second time. The bonus has to do with the cards, not the standard actions. The standard actions are unlimited, bonus, or otherwise.

----
Page 14

Each player may resolve the "Action:" ability on each of their cards in play once during this phase. Each player may resolve any number of the standard actions any number of times. Bonus: If you chose this phase, you may resolve the "Action:" ability on one of your cards in play an additional time.

----
Page 20

During this step, players resolve the phases that were chosen during the planning step. There are no turns, so each player plays each phase at the same time. All players may participate in the selected phases, but players only receive bonuses for the phase they selected. Bonuses are printed in the bottom section of the phase cards. The chosen phases are always resolved in the following order:

III. ACTION PHASE

- Each player may resolve the “Action:” ability on each of their blue cards in play once.

> In the original Terraforming Mars game you can spend Steel or Titanium to lower the cost for specific cards. Within the documentation of The Ares Expedition I found that having Steel and Titanium lowers the cost of specific cards, but I could not find that you have to spend the resources. E.g. if i have two steel to lower the cost of (mining) cards, do I spend the two steels, or do I keep them after lowering the cost of the card?
 
You don't have to spend them. Ares Expedition gets rid of the concept of steel and titanium as resources. Instead having steel and titanium is just a discount on cards with the relevant tags.

----
Page 5

B. Green cards have resources that are gained in the production phase or have steel/titanium capabilities which are used to reduce the cost of playing certain cards. See page 12 for more info on steel and titanium.

----
Page 12

The cost of Project cards with a building tag (an icon of a building tag), regardless of color, is reduced by 2 MC for each steel (an image of steel) you have.

The cost of Project cards with a space tag (an icon of a space tag), regardless of color, is reduced by 3 MC for each titanium (an image of titanium) you have.

The cost to play a card cannot be reduced below zero.

You may play cards that raise parameters beyond their maximums or add special resources when you don't have a card to add them to. You will simply not receive the benefits of those effects.

----
Page 13

Example: Bob wants to play Microprocessors, which is a green card that costs 17 MC. Microprocessors has a building tag (an icon of a building tag). (an icon of number 1) Bob has two steel, so his cost to play cards with building tags is reduced by 4 MC. (an icon of number 2) Bob chose the development phase this turn, so his cost to play this green card is reduced by 3 MC. Thus, Bob's cost to play Microprocessors is 17-4-3=10.

(an icon of number 3) Bob has 4 MC cubes which he can use to pay for the card, but that leaves Bob 6 MC short of playing it. Bob can discard two project cards from his hand at a rate of 3 MC each to pay for the remaining 6 MC. (an icon of number 4) Bob chooses to discard two cards and spends his 4 MC cubes, and places Microprocessors into play.

(an icon of number 5) Bob resolves the immediate effect of the card which is "Draw two cards. Then, discard a card." Finally, Bob is done with the development phase.

Some green cards give a player steel and titanium capabilities. They reduce the cost of playing project cards. The proper building materials are essential when starting an expensive project!

Read the first sentence of the Production Phase (p. 15) carefully. It says "Each player collects resources equal to the production on their green cards, corporation card, and place on the TR track." It does NOT mention referencing your player board because you technically do not need to use the player boards at all they are simply a note-taking device to help streamline the production step so you don't have to go through every single card in your tableau every time production happens. But that is why the green cards are worded the way they are, because every time production happens you re-evaluate your production values and take what they tell you to take. Using the player boards, It is much easier to keep on top of the small changes upfront. On p. 11, a red box in the Development Phase section reminds you to update your tracks when you play green cards that give you production (orange hashed box) or capabilities (grey hashed box). This is the only time you update your tracks: when you play green cards. 

----

After this phase is over, the Oxygen is done, and nobody can raise it for TR. They can still do any action that would raise the oxygen, but they would not get the TR. So if you get enough plants on a later action phase (before both temp and Oceans are done) you can still get a Greenery tile for it's endgame point, but no TR. Any other action that raises Oxygen as an effect can be activated similarly, without any TR.

The game ends at the end of the phase in which you've played all 9 oceans, reached +8 degrees Celsius, and 14% oxygen. This can happen on phases I, II, or III.

It's dependent on the flow of the game. The first player in real time to choose to flip an ocean does so. Etc. So the last ocean flipped in real time is the last ocean flipped. If a player uses an effect to flip two oceans at once, the last ocean flipped is the one they flipped over second. If they use both hands to flip them over at the same time to be a pain, then get new friends

In the phase that oxygen is maxed out, you can continue to get forest tiles and get VP for the tiles and TR for the associated oxygen. After that you can continue to get forest tiles, and they are still worth one VP, but they stop giving TR. This is true for both multiplayer and solo.

> When you spend 8 plants and/or 20 MC to raise the Oxygen you raise your TR also correct? But these actions also gives you a forest token so it is another TR per token when the game ends correct? So basically raising the oxygen gives you 1+1=2 TR in total compared to other standard actions that gives you only 1 TR. Is this right or wrong?

Raising Oxygen increases your TR, as long as Oxygen is not maxed out at the start of the Phase. The Forest token gives you a victory point at the end of the game. As TR is converted to victory points at game end then yes, you could in effect score 2 VPs for a Forest tile. But note the difference between TR (usable on future turns to generate income) and VPs (apply only at the end of the game). This action does give you 2 points (1 for the TR, 1 for the forest token), but only a single TR on the track (for income, etc.)

You both get as many oceans as you can afford. To determine which bonus you get it is important to only flip one ocean tile at a time. Whichever ocean tile was flipped last has the bonus that will be awarded to all further ocean actions for the rest of the phase.

Simultaneous play is intended to be played per phase, not uninterrupted for the entire round. The check for card requirements (i.e. minimum Oxygen) is determined at the beginning of the phase it was played. If some players have already moved to Phase V, while you're still playing a card in Phase I, it would be really hard to determine if the requirements were met when all players were in Phase I. The rulebook states that all players must complete a phase before proceeding to the next phase that was played. So everyone must complete phase 1 before moving on to phase 2

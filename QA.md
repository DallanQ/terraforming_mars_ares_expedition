[solo-mode-identical-phase-selectiondraw](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2701856/solo-mode-identical-phase-selectiondraw)

> In solo mode, if the same phase card that I selected emerges after drawing from the dummy hand, do I play the phase twice?

No, you don't. You just play that phase once and you will have the action bonus for playing the card for it. It would just be like if you were playing with another player and both played the same action.

[first-solo-play-a-few-clarifications](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2721839/first-solo-play-a-few-clarifications)

> In Solo mode in Novice mode at what point do you raise the oxygen or temperature 2 steps when the AI uses all 5 phase cards?  Is it as soon as the AI plays that last phase card (so before the phases actually play out) or at the end of that round?

You raise oxygen or temperature right after you move the tracker cube one spot up, after the round of the 5th card. This means: a) you fully play both phases you and the AI played, and once you start to prepare the next round (shuffle AI cards and move the tracker) you will raise one of the tracks; b) you will do this a total of 4 times (in novice means you do a total of 8 raises, 4x2)

> In Solo mode in Novice mode do you have to raise either oxygen or temperature 2 steps and can’t raise each once instead?

Quoting: "Increase oxygen OR temperature 2 steps after advancing the dummy player's cube." 
The rules specifically state that you can raise one or the other and not both.

> The rules say the solo game ends when the AI has played its final phase card but does it actually mean at the end of that round? 

Yes, at the end of the round.

[exchanging-cards-for-mc](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2704875/exchanging-cards-for-mc)

> Can you exchange cards for 3 MC each at any time or just during development?

Yes, you can do it at any time

> When I exchange cards to buy standard projects, does that exchange include an Action phase?

Yes, If the game ends during the Action phase, players will likely want to convert all of their cards in hand and MC into standard actions that gain TR.

[mining-guild-card-214-inquiry](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2714723/mining-guild-card-214-inquiry)

> The effect on the card reads, "Each time you play steel production..." How do folks interpret this card?
> a. Whenever you build another green card which has steel production in the orange box OR
> b. Whenever you build something requiring steel production (i.e. another card)

"Whenever you build another green card which has steel production in the orange box". There is only one card in the game that requires steel production. It has a I because that is the only phase that will give you cards that will give you steel production.

> In solo mode, say i played production in the last phase of one round, i go to end step and then start a new round. Can i play the production phase now as it is a new round… how do you guys play it for solo?

You can't play production two phases in a roll.

[basic-question-about-productionresource-tracking-f](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2850193/basic-question-about-productionresource-tracking-f)

> Should the MC cubes on the right side of the board correspond to the number on the left track? If so, is this redundant? If not, what is the distinction I'm missing?

The tracks on the left should correspond to the number of relevant production icons in your played projects. They track the rate at which you produce resources. They are generally advanced as a result of a Development or Construction phase. The bins on the right contain your current actual resources as a result of accumulated production (minus spending). They increase during a Production phase and they are spent during an Action phase.

[how-do-tags-work](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2859037/how-do-tags-work)

> how do tags work? for example, there is the corporation arklight, which says to add an animal to it every time it plays an animal / plant mark, including itself. the question is do i add the animal once per card or per mark? for the corporation card itself, I immediately add two animals, since there are two marks, or one?

It should be activated per tag, so yes the corporation card should start with two animals on it. A card can trigger the same effect multiple times.
See page 5 step 6 of the rulebook. So if you play a card with a plant and animal tag, and you have a card that triggers when you play either of those two tags, it will trigger twice

[atmosphere-filtering-do-you-gain-a-tr-with-the-rai](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3031362/atmosphere-filtering-do-you-gain-a-tr-with-the-rai)

> The card Atmosphere filtering #67, says required 2 science, raise the oxygen 1 step. Do I gain a TR when I raise this oxygen 1 step?

Yes. Whenever you increase any of the three parameters by any means, you increase your TR respectively unless the card says otherwise.

[order-of-turn-during-action-phase](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2831785/order-of-turn-during-action-phase)

> Should we play one action at a time during the action phase or do all your actions one time and then it's the other player turn?

When you raise any of the global parameters to its maximum on a single phase, everyone continues to get the benefit. There is no "first come" basis because of the simultaneous nature of this version of the game. So when it maxes out, during the same phase, everyone can continue to get the benefit. Then starting the next phase, it is no longer available.
If it is the oceans that hit their max, then everyone gets the reward shown on the last tile flipped.

> Mining Guild's Effect mentions steel production in Phase I, but wouldn't steel production be in Phase IV?

Each time you play a green card with steel production on it.

Multiple, one TR per steel increase.

[when-to-track-and-when-to-gain-resources](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3035612/when-to-track-and-when-to-gain-resources)

> When do you gain resources vs. when do you move your track (player board up)?

Read the first sentence of the Production Phase (p. 15) carefully. It says "Each player collects resources equal to the production on their green cards, corporation card, and place on the TR track." It does NOT mention referencing your player board because you technically do not need to use the player boards at all they are simply a note-taking device to help streamline the production step so you don't have to go through every single card in your tableau every time production happens. But that is why the green cards are worded the way they are, because every time production happens you re-evaluate your production values and take what they tell you to take. Using the player boards, It is much easier to keep on top of the small changes upfront. On p. 11, a red box in the Development Phase section reminds you to update your tracks when you play green cards that give you production (orange hashed box) or capabilities (grey hashed box). This is the only time you update your tracks: when you play green cards. 

[special-resources](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2680466/special-resources)

> How do you keep track of different special resources on cards?

Use the resource cubes.

> But how will I not mix it with other special resources?

Put the cubes on each card that collects them. That will keep them separate.

That is correct, but note that it is not a rebate. It's not "Pay 15, get back 4", it's "Pay 11".

If a player raises the related global parameter multiple times during a phase, does the effect adds multiple special (animal/science) resources to the cards? 

Yes. The effect triggers whenever the condition is met, so if the condition is met multiple times in the same phase, the effect triggers multiple times.

That's just simply a reminder that you can discard cards for 3MC each. This isn't a one off, it can happen multiple times in a row.
